# Open Knowledge Format (OKF) with markdown-vault-mcp

[Open Knowledge Format](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog) (OKF) is a vendor-neutral convention for a folder of markdown files that serves as curated context for AI agents. A bundle is a directory of notes with YAML frontmatter: one concept per file, the file path as the concept identity, and a small set of frontmatter fields that describe each note's type, lifecycle, provenance, and trust. This guide shows how markdown-vault-mcp recognises OKF bundles, what it does with the metadata, and how to move an existing vault into the format.

!!! note
    OKF support is read-only by default. Recognising a bundle only ever adds annotations and advice; it never changes your files. The migration tools that do change files are explicit, and this guide covers them near the end.

## How the server recognises a bundle

The server treats a vault as an OKF bundle when the root `index.md` declares a version in its frontmatter:

```yaml
---
okf_version: "0.2"
---
# My bundle
```

This declaration travels with the vault, so the same bundle behaves the same way here and in other OKF tools. The `MARKDOWN_VAULT_MCP_OKF_MODE` environment variable controls how the server responds to it:

| Value | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| `auto` (default) | Apply OKF read semantics when the root `index.md` declares `okf_version`. |
| `off` | Never apply OKF semantics, and hide the OKF tools. Use this if your frontmatter happens to use keys such as `status` for an unrelated purpose. |
| `on` | Force OKF semantics even without a declaration. Use this for a bundle you consume but do not own. |

Check the current state at any time through the `okf` section of the `stats` tool, or the `config://vault` resource.

## What the metadata means

On a recognised bundle, the server reads a few OKF frontmatter families and surfaces them in `search`, `read`, and `get_context` results under an `okf` key:

- **Type**: the free-text `type` field, such as `Playbook`, `Metric`, or `Reference`.
- **Lifecycle**: `status` is one of `draft`, `stable`, or `deprecated`. A note with no `status` is treated as `stable`. `stale_after: YYYY-MM-DD` marks a note stale once that date passes.
- **Trust tier**: derived from the `verified` list. A note verified by a person (`by: human:...`) is `human-reviewed`; a note verified only by a process is `machine-confirmed`; an unverified note is `unverified`.
- **Sources**: the `sources` provenance list, surfaced in full on `read` and as a count on search hits.

You can filter on these dimensions. `search` and `list_documents` accept `status`, `stale`, `trust_tier`, and `type` filters, so `{"stale": "true"}` or `{"status": "deprecated"}` builds a triage listing. See the [tools reference](../tools/index.md) for the full filter set.

## Frontmatter fields

A conformant note needs only a non-empty `type`. Everything else is optional but recommended:

```yaml
---
type: Playbook
title: Onboarding a new teammate
description: Step-by-step setup for the first week.
tags: [process, people]
status: stable
stale_after: 2027-01-01
sources:
  - resource: https://example.com/handbook
    id: handbook
verified:
  - by: human:alex
    at: 2026-08-01
---
```

## Migrating an existing vault

Adoption is incremental. A note is either conformant or not, and the server tolerates a mix, so you can convert a vault gradually rather than in one step. The recommended order is a ratchet: declare early so new notes are written correctly, then converge the backlog.

### 1. Audit

Run the `okf_validate` tool to see where the vault stands. It reports conformance as a degree rather than a pass or fail. The report gives the conformant count out of the total, alongside a per-rule breakdown with example paths (notes missing a `type`, unknown `status` values, and the like). The audit reads from disk, so it works before you declare anything. Use it to decide whether to start.

### 2. Declare

Add `okf_version: "0.2"` to the root `index.md` frontmatter. From this point the server annotates results, the filters work, and the agent receives guidance to keep OKF conventions when it edits. Declaring early means every new note is authored conformantly while you work through the backlog.

### 3. Enrich

Backfill the missing metadata. This is where most of the work is, and an agent can do it note by note. For each note it proposes a `type` from the content and fills in the `title` and `description`. Approve the changes in batches, then re-run `okf_validate` to watch the conformant count climb.

### 4. Mechanical transforms

Three tools handle the changes you should not make by hand. They are write tools, so they are hidden in read-only mode and when `OKF_MODE` is `off`, and on a git-backed vault each change is committed.

- **`okf_convert_links`** rewrites `[[wikilinks]]` as the root-absolute markdown links OKF recommends, such as `[text](/guides/note.md)`. Only links whose target exists are converted, so your link graph is preserved exactly. Unresolvable wikilinks are left alone and reported. You can write in either link style day to day; run this before sharing the bundle.
- **`okf_generate_index`** writes a folder's `index.md` as a listing of the notes directly in that folder, plus a pointer into each subfolder's own `index.md`. It draws the description from each note's frontmatter and lists one level at a time, so a nested bundle stays navigable rather than flattening into one long page. It preserves existing frontmatter, so regenerating the root `index.md` keeps your `okf_version` declaration.
- **`okf_seed_log`** creates a `log.md` change history from the vault's git commits, newest first. It refuses to overwrite an existing `log.md`, so a hand-maintained history is safe.

## Using OKF with PARA or Zettelkasten

OKF composes with the [PARA](para.md) and [Zettelkasten](zettelkasten.md) methods. They organise where notes live and how work flows; OKF describes what each note is. A PARA or Zettelkasten vault can also be an OKF bundle. Three points of overlap matter:

- **Status vocabulary**: PARA uses `status` for workflow state (`active`, `archived`), while OKF uses it for lifecycle (`draft`, `stable`, `deprecated`). These mean different things, so keep PARA's workflow state in its own frontmatter key and reserve `status` for OKF lifecycle. OKF preserves any extra keys you add.
- **Untyped inbox notes**: PARA's inbox holds quick captures that are typed later. Give them a placeholder `type: Capture` so they are conformant from the start, and let triage set the real type.
- **Wikilinks**: write in whichever link style you prefer. The server resolves both, and `okf_convert_links` produces the OKF link style when you are ready to share the bundle.

## Exporting a bundle

When you want a conformant copy to share or hand to other OKF tooling, download one through the standard `create_download_link` tool with a bundle reference rather than a file path:

- `create_download_link` with `ref="okf-bundle"` returns a one-time URL for a zip of the whole vault.
- `create_download_link` with `ref="okf-bundle:guides"` scopes the zip to a folder subtree.

The export reads from the live vault and never changes it. Wikilinks become the root-absolute markdown links OKF recommends. Convention files (`_conventions.md`) and the template folder are left out, while the reserved `index.md` and `log.md` stay in. Non-conformant notes appear as they are, so the archive is a faithful snapshot. Run `okf_validate` for the residual conformance gaps; the archive itself carries no gap report.

Bundle export needs an HTTP or SSE transport with `MARKDOWN_VAULT_MCP_BASE_URL` set, the same requirement as any transfer link, and it is unavailable when `OKF_MODE` is `off`. A git-backed vault also remains a shareable bundle on its own: the repository is an interchange format.
